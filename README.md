# ADAS1000
This is a library was adapted for arduino from the No OS driver provided by Analog Devices for ADAS1000 AFE for bippotential signal acquisition.  
It was developedas part of my Capstone project in 2016 - 2017 at University of Manitoba.

The library was tested and implemented on Adafruit 32u4 Bluefruit LE Feather board. I designed a PCB that housed the following hardware:
- ADAS1000 AFE
- Connection for MAX30100 pulse oximeter (This already has an arduino library present on Github).
